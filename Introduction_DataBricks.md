# Introduction DataBricks


### Basic Fundamentals

- **Databricks is primarily written** in programming languages such as Scala, Python, and Java.

   1. **Scala is the primary language** used for developing the core functionalities of the Apache Spark engine.

   2. **Python is commonly** used for scripting and data analysis tasks within the Databricks environment.

   3. **Java is utilized** for certain backend components and extensions.

- Additionally, Databricks provides support for other languages such as R and **SQL for data manipulation and analysis within its platform.**
   

## Apache Spark

**Apache spark** Is an open source data processing framework and is the engine underneath Databricks

### Key benefit
- Extensible, flexible open source framework
  - Flexible in terms of the data source,including **data structured (like csv or parquet file),semi structured data (JSON) and unstructured data (text files).**
  - Flexible in terms of the processing it supports, including **batch process, real time stream process, machine learning and graph processing.**
- Large developer community
  - **Contributing code**
  - **Reviewing code**
  - **Answering questions**
  - **Writing documentation**
  - **Organizing events**
- high performing
  - **In memory processing**
  - **Distributed computing**
  - **Fault tolerance**
  - **Optimized execution engine**
  - **Supports for multiple workloads**
- Databricks optimizations
